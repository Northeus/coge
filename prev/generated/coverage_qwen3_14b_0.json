Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to create a coverpoint for the ACT signal using the coverpoint function. Then, for each transition, I should use the sequence function. Each transition is a list of integers representing the sequence of values. So for 0 -> 1, the sequence is [0, 1], and for 1 -> 0, it's [1, 0]. \n\nWait, the sequence function takes a list of integers and creates a sequence that checks for that transition. So I need to create two separate sequences for each transition. Then, maybe I need to store them in variables. The user didn't mention any cross coverage here, just the transitions. So the code should be straightforward.\n\nLet me check the API again. The sequence function is part of the coverage API. So the steps are: create the coverpoint, then create two sequences for each transition. Each sequence is added as a separate object. The variables should be stored so they can be used later. \n\nI need to make sure that the code uses the correct function names and parameters. The coverpoint is 'ACT', and each sequence is a list of two elements. So the code should look like:\n\nact = coverpoint('ACT')\nseq0 = sequence(act, [0, 1])\nseq1 = sequence(act, [1, 0])\n\nYes, that should do it.

So I need to create two separate sequences for each transition.\n\nSo, first create the coverpoint for RST. Then, create two sequences: one for [0, 1] and another for [1, 0]. Each of these sequences should have at_least set to 5. \n\nWait, the sequence function's parameters are coverpoint, sequence (list of ints), and at_least. So each transition is a separate sequence.

Specificilly, create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE - 5:MAX_VALUE]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The user wants to create different bins for the REG_A signal. Let me break down the requirements step by step.\n\nFirst, they mention creating separate bins for specific ranges. The first is value 0. That's straightforward; I can use normal_bin with the value 0.\n\nNext, a single value from the range [1:5]. Wait, the wording here is a bit confusing. The user says \"single value from range [1:5]\". Does that mean they want a bin that covers any value in that range, or specifically one value within that range? The example in the API shows normal_bins for a range, but the user might want a single bin that covers the entire range. But the wording says \"single value from range\", which might be a typo. Maybe they mean a bin that covers the entire range 1 to 5. So I'll use normal_bins with (1,5) to cover all values in that range.\n\nThen, MAX VALUE. The max value of REG_A can be calculated using port_width. So 2^port_width('REG_A') - 1. So I need to compute that and use it in a normal_bin.\n\nLastly, a single value from the range [MAX_VALUE - 5 : MAX_VALUE]. Again, similar to the previous point. The max value minus 5 to max value. So I need to calculate that range. But since the user says \"single value from range\", maybe they want a bin that covers that entire range. So using normal_bins with (max_val -5, max_val).\n\nWait, but the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE - 5:MAX_VALUE]\". So each of these is a separate bin. But the second and fourth points are ranges. However, the API has normal_bin for a single value or a range. Wait, the normal_bin can take a tuple (range) or an int. So for the second point, if they want a single value from the range [1:5], maybe they mean that they want to cover any value in that range. But the wording is unclear. Alternatively, maybe they want to select one specific value within that range, but the user didn't specify which one. But since the example in the API uses normal_bins for a range, perhaps the user intended to cover all values in [1:5], so using normal_bins with (1,5). Similarly for the last part, the range [max_val -5, max_val], so normal_bins with that range.\n\nBut the user says \"single value from range [1:5]\". That's confusing. Maybe they meant a bin that covers a single value (like 3) but selected from the range. But since the user didn't specify, perhaps it's a mistake and they meant to cover the entire range. Alternatively, maybe they want a bin that checks if any value in that range is hit. In that case, using normal_bins for the range.\n\nSo, proceeding with that assumption.\n\nSo steps:\n\n1. Create coverpoint for REG_A.\n\n2. For value 0: normal_bin(reg_a, 0).\n\n3. For range [1:5]: normal_bins(reg_a, (1,5)).\n\nWait, but the API has normal_bins which creates multiple bins for each value in the range. However, the user says \"create a separate bins for: ... single value from range [1:5]\". Maybe they want a single bin that covers the entire range. But the API's normal_bin can take a range as a tuple. Wait, looking back at the API:\n\nnormal_bin(coverpoint, values: tuple[int, int] | int, ...). So if you pass a tuple, it's for a range. But the description says \"checking that a single value (int) or a value within a range... is sampled\". So if you pass a tuple, it's a range, and the bin is for any value in that range. So for the [1:5] part, the user wants a bin that covers any value in that range. So using normal_bin with (1,5).\n\nBut the user says \"single value from range [1:5]\". Maybe they want a single bin that represents that range. But the wording is unclear. However, given the API, I think that's the correct approach.\n\nThen, the MAX VALUE: compute max_val = 2^port_width('REG_A') -1, then normal_bin(reg_a, max_val).\n\nFor the last part: [max_val -5 : max_val]. So the range from max_val -5 to max_val. So normal_bin(reg_a, (max_val -5, max_val)).\n\nBut wait, the user says \"single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". Again, same confusion. But assuming that they want the entire range, so normal_bin with that tuple.\n\nBut the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE - 5:MAX_VALUE]\". So each of these is a separate bin. So for the first part, value 0 is a single bin. The second part, the range [1:5] is a single bin (covering any value in that range). The third part, MAX_VALUE is a single bin. The fourth part, the range [max_val-5:max_val] is a single bin. So in total, four bins.\n\nBut the API's normal_bin can take a tuple (range) or an int. So for each of these, we can create a normal_bin.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nreg_a = coverpoint('REG_A')\n\nmax_val = 2 ** port_width('REG_A') - 1\n\nbin0 = normal_bin(reg_a, 0)\n\nbin1_5 = normal_bin(reg_a, (1,5))\n\nbin_max = normal_bin(reg_a, max_val)\n\nbin_max_5 = normal_bin(reg_a, (max_val -5, max_val))\n\nBut wait, the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE - 5:MAX_VALUE]\". So each of these is a separate bin. So the code would create four bins.\n\nBut the user might have intended that for the [1:5] part, they want individual bins for each value, but the wording is unclear. However, the example given in the user's previous question used normal_bins for a range, which creates multiple bins. But the current user's instruction says \"create a separate bins for: ... single value from range [1:5]\". So perhaps they want a single bin that covers the range [1:5], not individual bins for each value. Hence, using normal_bin with the tuple (1,5).\n\nTherefore, the code would be as above.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom coverage import *\n\nreg_a = coverpoint('REG_A')\nmax_val = 2 ** port_width('REG_A') - 1\n\nbin_zero = normal_bin(reg_a, 0)\nbin_range_1_5 = normal_bin(reg_a, (1, 5))\nbin_max_value = normal_bin(reg_a, max_val)\nbin_range_max_5 = normal_bin(reg_a, (max_val - 5, max_val))\n```"}], "status": "ok"}, {"code": "from coverage import *\n\nreg_b = coverpoint('REG_B')\nmax_value = 2 ** port_width('REG_B') - 1\n\nbin_zero = normal_bin(reg_b, 0)\nbin_range_1_5 = normal_bin(reg_b, (1, 5))\nbin_max = normal_bin(reg_b, max_value)\nbin_range_max_5 = normal_bin(reg_b, (max_value - 5, max_value))\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a verification engineer whose goal is to implement a functional coverage code snippet using the provided API in a Python based on the provided requirement.

The user wants to create different bins for the REG_B signal. The specific requirements are: a bin for value 0, a single value from [1:5], the MAX VALUE, and another single value from [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to get the MAX_VALUE for REG_B. The port_width function can help here. So MAX_VALUE would be 2^port_width('REG_B') - 1. I'll calculate that first.\n\nNext, creating the coverpoint for REG_B. Using the coverpoint function with 'REG_B' as the port name.\n\nFor the first bin, value 0. That's straightforward with normal_bin, passing 0 as the value.\n\nThen, for the range [1:5]. Since the user wants a single value from this range, maybe they mean any value in that range? But the normal_bin can take a tuple for a range. Wait, the normal_bin's values parameter can be a tuple (start, end), which would cover all values in that range. But the user says \"single value from range [1:5]\". Hmm, maybe they want a bin that covers any value in that range. So using normal_bin with (1,5) as the values.\n\nThen, the MAX VALUE. That's the maximum value of REG_B, which we calculated earlier. So another normal_bin with that value.\n\nNext, the range [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. Again, using a tuple for the range. So normal_bin with (MAX_VALUE -5, MAX_VALUE).\n\nWait, but the user says \"a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5: MAX_VALUE]\". Maybe they want a specific value in that range? But the wording is a bit unclear. However, based on previous examples, when they say \"single value from a range\", they might mean that the bin covers any value in that range. So using the normal_bin with the tuple for that range.\n\nPutting it all together: create the coverpoint, calculate MAX_VALUE, then create each bin with the specified ranges and values. Assign each bin to a variable so they can be used later. Also, check if any of these bins might overlap, but since 0 is separate, [1:5] is a range, MAX is a single value, and the last range is from MAX-5 to MAX, which might include MAX again. But the user probably wants MAX to be a separate bin, and the last range as another bin. However, if MAX is in both the MAX bin and the last range, that's okay because the bins are separate.

The user wants to create different bins for the MEM signal. First, I need to figure out how to handle each part of the requirement.\n\nThe first part is a bin for value 0. That's straightforward using normal_bin with the value 0.\n\nNext, a single value from the range [1:5]. Since it's a range, but they want a single value, maybe they mean any value in that range? Wait, the normal_bin can take a tuple for a range. But the user says \"single value from range\", which is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe they want a bin that covers any value between 1 and 5. So using normal_bin with the tuple (1,5). But the description says \"single value (int) or a value within a range\". So maybe the user wants to cover that entire range as a single bin. So normal_bin with (1,5) would check that any value in that range is sampled. But the wording says \"single value from range\", which might mean that they want to have a bin that is triggered if any value in that range is hit. So that's covered by normal_bin with the range.\n\nThen, MAX VALUE. The max value for MEM can be calculated using port_width. So max_mem = 2 ** port_width('MEM') - 1. Then, create a normal_bin for that value.\n\nLastly, a single value from the range [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. So that's a range from (max_mem -5) to max_mem. Again, using normal_bin with that tuple.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nFirst, create the coverpoint for MEM. Then, calculate max_mem. Then create each bin as specified. Each bin is a separate normal_bin. So variables for each bin. Then, perhaps collect them into a list if needed, but the user didn't mention cross coverage, so maybe just create each bin individually.\n\nWait, the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". So four separate bins. So each is a normal_bin.\n\nSo code steps:\n\nmem = coverpoint('MEM')\n\nmax_mem = 2 ** port_width('MEM') - 1\n\nbin0 = normal_bin(mem, 0)\n\nbin1_5 = normal_bin(mem, (1,5))\n\nbin_max = normal_bin(mem, max_mem)\n\nbin_max_range = normal_bin(mem, (max_mem -5, max_mem))\n\nBut wait, the user says \"single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". Wait, that's a range, but the bin is for that entire range. So the bin would be triggered if any value in that range is hit. So the normal_bin with the tuple.\n\nSo the code should be as above. Make sure all variables are stored. Also, check if the parameters are correctly passed. The normal_bin can take a tuple for the range. So yes.\n\nI think that's all.

The user wants to create different bins for the IMM signal. First, I need to figure out how to get the maximum value for IMM. The port_width function can help here. So MAX_IMM would be 2^port_width('IMM') - 1.\n\nThen, the requirements are: a bin for value 0, a single value from 1 to 5, the max value, and another single value from [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. Wait, but the normal_bin can take a range or a single value. For the first part, value 0 is straightforward with normal_bin(imm, 0). \n\nFor the range [1:5], since they want a single value from that range, maybe using normal_bin with the tuple (1,5)? But the normal_bin's description says that if you pass a tuple, it checks all values in the range. Wait, no, the user says \"single value from range [1:5]\". Hmm, maybe they want a bin that covers any value in that range. Wait, but the example in the first user message used normal_bins for a range. Wait, the user's instruction here says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\".\n\nWait, maybe the wording is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The user says \"for single value from range [1:5]\". That might mean that they want a bin that covers exactly one value within that range. But how? Because the API's normal_bin can take a range (tuple) and it checks all values in that range. But if they want a single value, maybe they mean that they want a bin that matches any value in that range. Wait, perhaps the user intended to have a bin that covers the entire range [1-5], but the wording says \"single value from range\". Maybe that's a mistake, and they actually want a bin that covers the entire range. Or maybe they want a single bin that represents a value in that range. But the API's normal_bin with a tuple would cover all values in the range. So perhaps the user wants a bin that covers any value between 1 and 5. So using normal_bin with (1,5). Similarly for the other range.\n\nBut then, the user also mentions \"MAX VALUE\", which is straightforward with normal_bin(imm, MAX_IMM). Then the last part is a single value from [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. Again, that would be a range, so using normal_bin with (MAX_IMM -5, MAX_IMM). \n\nWait, but the user says \"single value from range\" for both [1:5] and [MAX-5:MAX]. Maybe that's a misunderstanding. If the user wants to have a bin that matches any value in that range, then using normal_bin with the tuple is correct. But if they want a bin that matches exactly one value (like a specific value), then they should pass that value as an int. But the wording is unclear. However, looking back at the example provided by the user in the first example, when they wanted to check all values of OP, they used normal_bins with (0, max_op). So perhaps in this case, the user wants to have bins for the ranges. \n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nFirst, create the coverpoint for IMM. Then, get MAX_IMM. Then create bins for 0, the range 1-5, MAX_IMM, and the range MAX_IMM-5 to MAX_IMM. So:\n\nimm = coverpoint('IMM')\nmax_imm = 2 ** port_width('IMM') - 1\n\nzero_bin = normal_bin(imm, 0)\nrange1_bin = normal_bin(imm, (1,5))\nmax_bin = normal_bin(imm, max_imm)\nrange2_bin = normal_bin(imm, (max_imm -5, max_imm))\n\nBut wait, the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". So the wording for the first range is \"single value from range [1:5]\". Maybe the user meant that they want a single bin that covers that entire range. So the code above is correct.\n\nBut the problem is that the normal_bin with a tuple (a, b) creates a bin that checks all values in the range. So in this case, for the first range, the bin would check that all values from 1 to 5 are covered. But the user says \"for single value from range [1:5]\". Maybe that's a mistake and they meant that they want a single bin that covers the entire range. Alternatively, maybe they want a bin that matches any single value in that range. But that's the same as covering the entire range. So the code as written would be correct.\n\nAnother possibility is that the user wants to have a bin for each individual value in the ranges. For example, for [1:5], create bins for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. But that would require using normal_bins with the range (1,5), which would generate multiple bins. However, the user's wording says \"create a separate bins for: ... for single value from range [1:5]\". So maybe they want a single bin that covers any value in that range. Therefore, using normal_bin(imm, (1,5)) is correct.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nimm = coverpoint('IMM')\nmax_imm = 2 ** port_width('IMM') - 1\n\nzero_bin = normal_bin(imm, 0)\nrange1_bin = normal_bin(imm, (1, 5))\nmax_bin = normal_bin(imm, max_imm)\nrange2_bin = normal_bin(imm, (max_imm - 5, max_imm))\n\nBut the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". So the four bins are: 0, [1-5], max, [max-5 to max]. So the code would have four separate bins. The answer should include all four. So the variables zero_bin, range1_bin, max_bin, range2_bin are created. Then, perhaps the user might want to collect them into a list if needed, but the problem says to store the objects in variables. So the code as written would be correct.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\nimm = coverpoint('IMM')\nmax_imm = 2 ** port_width('IMM') - 1\nzero_bin = normal_bin(imm, 0)\nrange1_bin = normal_bin(imm, (1, 5))\nmax_bin = normal_bin(imm, max_imm)\nrange2_bin = normal_bin(imm, (max_imm - 5, max_imm))\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom coverage import *\n\nimm = coverpoint('IMM')\nmax_imm = 2 ** port_width('IMM') - 1\nzero_bin = normal_bin(imm, 0)\nrange1_bin = normal_bin(imm, (1, 5))\nmax_bin = normal_bin(imm, max_imm)\nrange2_bin = normal_bin(imm, (max_imm - 5, max_imm))\n```"}], "status": "ok"}, {"code": "from coverage import *\n\nmovi = coverpoint('MOVI')\nmax_movi = 2 ** port_width('MOVI') - 1\nmovi_bins = normal_bins(movi, (0, max_movi))\nillegal_3 = illegal_bin(movi, 3)\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a verification engineer whose goal is to implement a functional coverage code snippet using the provided API in a Python based on the provided requirement.

The user wants to check all values of the MOVI signal but also mark the value 3 as illegal. So first, I need to create a coverpoint for MOVI. Then, to cover all values, I should use normal_bins with the range from 0 to the maximum value of MOVI. The maximum can be calculated using port_width('MOVI').\n\nWait, the port_width function returns the size in bits. So the max value is 2^port_width -1. Right. So I'll compute that and use it in normal_bins.\n\nThen, for the illegal value 3, I need to create an illegal_bin on the same coverpoint. The illegal_bin will check that 3 is never sampled. So the parameters for illegal_bin would be the coverpoint and the value 3. Also, the at_least parameter is 1 by default, which is okay here.\n\nI need to make sure that both the normal_bins and the illegal_bin are created and stored in variables. The cross function isn't needed here since it's just a single coverpoint with two different bins. So the code should be:\n\nCreate the coverpoint, calculate max value, create normal_bins for all values, then create illegal_bin for 3.\n\nWait, but the user said \"all values of MOVI signal were tested\" so the normal_bins should cover all possible values. But if the port has a certain width, say 4 bits, then max is 15. But the illegal_bin is for 3, which is within that range. So the normal_bins would include 3, but the illegal_bin would mark it as illegal. But that's okay because the illegal_bin is for values that should not be sampled. However, the normal_bins would require that all values are covered, including 3. But the illegal_bin is for 3, which is a contradiction. Wait, maybe the user wants that all values except 3 are covered, and 3 is illegal. But the way the API works, the normal_bins would check that all values are sampled, but the illegal_bin would check that 3 is never sampled. But that's conflicting. However, the user's requirement is to check that all values were tested (so normal_bins for all) and also that 3 is illegal (so illegal_bin for 3). But in reality, if 3 is illegal, it should not be sampled, so it's impossible to have it in normal_bins. But the user might want to ensure that all values except 3 are covered, but the way the API is structured, the normal_bins would include 3, but the illegal_bin would check that 3 is not present. So maybe the user's intention is to have all values except 3 covered, but the API might not support that directly. However, the user's instruction says to check that all values of MOVI were tested, and differentiate that 3 is unsupported. So perhaps the normal_bins should cover all values except 3, but that's not possible with the current API. Alternatively, the normal_bins covers all values, and the illegal_bin checks that 3 is not present. But that would mean that the coverage for 3 is not met, but the illegal_bin would require that 3 is not sampled. However, the user's requirement is to check that all values were tested, which would include 3, but the illegal_bin says that 3 is not allowed. That's conflicting, but maybe the user wants to have the coverage check for all values, and also have 3 marked as illegal. But that's contradictory. However, the user might not realize that, but the task is to follow their instructions. So proceed as per their request: create normal_bins for all values, and illegal_bin for 3. The user might have intended that the normal_bins should exclude 3, but the API doesn't have a way to do that. So the code would be:\n\nmovi = coverpoint('MOVI')\nmax_movi = 2 ** port_width('MOVI') -1\nmovi_bins = normal_bins(movi, (0, max_movi))\nillegal_3 = illegal_bin(movi, 3)\n\nBut this would require that all values, including 3, are sampled, but also that 3 is not sampled. Which is impossible, but the user's instruction says to do that. So the code must be written as per the user's request, even if logically conflicting. So proceed with that.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom coverage import *\n\nmovi = coverpoint('MOVI')\nmax_movi = 2 ** port_width('MOVI') - 1\nmovi_bins = normal_bins(movi, (0, max_movi))\nillegal_3 = illegal_bin(movi, 3)\n```"}], "status": "ok"}, {"code": "from coverage import *\n\nvld = coverpoint('VLD')\nseq1 = sequence(vld, [0, 1, 0])\nseq2 = sequence(vld, [0, 1, 1, 0])\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a verification engineer whose goal is to implement a functional coverage code snippet using the provided API in a Python based on the provided requirement.

The user wants to cover two specific transitions on the VLD signal. The transitions are 0 -> 1 -> 0 and 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0. \n\nFirst, I need to recall how the API works. The sequence function is used to define transitions. The parameter is a list of integers representing the sequence of values.\n\nFor the first transition, 0 -> 1 -> 0, that's a list [0, 1, 0]. The second one is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0, which would be [0, 1, 1, 0]. \n\nSo I need to create two separate sequences for each transition. Each sequence is created using the sequence function with the respective list. \n\nThe coverpoint for VLD is created first. Then, each sequence is added. The user didn't mention any other bins or cross coverage, so just the sequences are needed. \n\nI should make sure that the variables are stored properly. The sequences should be assigned to variables, maybe seq1 and seq2. \n\nWait, the example in the previous interaction used a variable 'seq' for a single sequence.

No need for cross or bins here. Just the two sequences. \n\nI need to check if the API allows multiple sequences on the same coverpoint. The answer is yes, because each sequence is a separate object. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\nvld = coverpoint('VLD')\nsequence1 = sequence(vld, [0, 1, 0])\nsequence2 = sequence(vld, [0, 1, 1, 0])\n\nYes, that's correct.

The user wants to cross cover a small value from the range [0:1000] of registers REG_A and REG_B. So first, I need to create coverpoints for both REG_A and REG_B. Then, I need to create bins for each that cover the range 0 to 1000. Wait, but the user said \"small value\" \u2014 maybe they mean a specific range? But the example given in the problem statement uses a range from 0 to max_op, which is calculated using port_width. Here, the user specifies [0:1000], so maybe the range is explicitly 0 to 1000.\n\nSo, for each register, I need to create a normal bin that covers values from 0 to 1000. But wait, the normal_bins function takes a range (tuple of two integers) and creates bins for all values in that range. So for REG_A and REG_B, I'll use normal_bins with (0, 1000). Then, create a cross between the bins of REG_A and REG_B. \n\nWait, but the cross function requires a list of lists of bins. So, for each coverpoint, I need to get their bins. Let me check the API again. The cross function takes bin_groups as a list of lists of Bin. So for example, if I have two coverpoints, each with their own bins, I need to pass a list containing each coverpoint's bins as a sublist. \n\nSo the steps would be:\n\n1. Create coverpoints for REG_A and REG_B.\n2. For each, create normal_bins covering 0 to 1000.\n3. Use cross with the two lists of bins.\n\nBut wait, the user says \"cross cover a small value from range [0:1000]\". Maybe they mean that for each register, we are considering the small values in that range. But the example in the problem statement uses normal_bins with a range. So I think the correct approach is to create normal_bins for each register in the 0-1000 range, then cross them.\n\nBut wait, the normal_bins function creates bins for all values in the range. So if the range is 0 to 1000, it would create 1001 bins (assuming inclusive). But maybe the user wants to check all combinations of values in that range for REG_A and REG_B. However, that would be a huge cross, but the user's instruction says \"small value\", perhaps implying that the range is [0:1000], which is a specific range, not the entire port's width.\n\nBut the problem is, the user might have intended that the small value is a specific value, but the wording is a bit ambiguous. However, the example given in the problem for cross coverage uses normal_bins with a range (0,7) for OP and (0,2) for SEL. So following that, the user's instruction here is to create a cross between the ranges [0:1000] of REG_A and REG_B. Therefore, the code would be:\n\nCreate coverpoints for REG_A and REG_B. Then, create normal_bins for each with the range (0, 1000). Then cross those two lists of bins.\n\nWait, but the normal_bins function returns a list of Bin objects. So for REG_A, we have a list of bins covering 0-1000, same for REG_B. Then, cross([reg_a_bins, reg_b_bins]) would create a cross coverage that checks all combinations of values in those ranges.\n\nBut the user says \"cross cover a small value from range [0:1000] of registers REG_A and REG_B\". Maybe \"small value\" is a typo and they meant \"values\", but the main point is to cross the ranges. So the code would be as follows:\n\nreg_a = coverpoint('REG_A')\nreg_a_bins = normal_bins(reg_a, (0, 1000))\n\nreg_b = coverpoint('REG_B')\nreg_b_bins = normal_bins(reg_b, (0, 1000))\n\ncross_coverage = cross([reg_a_bins, reg_b_bins])\n\nThat's the code.

The user didn't specify, but the port_width function can get that.

So I'll use normal_bins on DATA with (0, 1000).\n\nNext, for OP, the first four operations. Assuming OP is a signal that has values representing operations. The first four operations would be values 0, 1, 2, 3. So create a normal_bin for OP covering 0 to 3.
