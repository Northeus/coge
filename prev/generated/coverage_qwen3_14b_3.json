The user wants to cover transitions 0 to 1 and 1 to 0 on the ACT signal. So, first, I need to create a coverpoint for the ACT port. Then, use the sequence function to define those transitions.\n\nWait, the sequence function takes a list of integers representing the transition. So for 0 -> 1, the list would be [0, 1], and for 1 -> 0, it's [1, 0]. But the user wants both transitions covered. So I need to create two separate sequences for each transition.\n\nWait, but the sequence function is called once per transition. So I should create two separate sequence objects. Let me check the API again. The sequence function returns a Sequence object, which is added to the coverage model. So each transition needs its own sequence.\n\nSo the steps are: create the coverpoint for ACT, then create two sequences, one for [0,1] and another for [1,0]. Each sequence is added to the coverage model. Then, maybe check if they are stored in variables. The user's example in the previous message stored the sequence in a variable called seq. So I should do the same here.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndata = coverpoint('ACT')\nseq1 = sequence(data, [0, 1])\nseq2 = sequence(data, [1, 0])\n\nBut wait, the user's example used the same variable name. But in this case, two separate sequences are needed. So the variables seq1 and seq2 would be the two sequences. But the user's example had one sequence. However, the problem requires both transitions, so two sequences are necessary.\n\nYes, that's correct. So the code should create two sequences for the two transitions. That's how the API works.

Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to create coverpoints for both ACT and RST. Using the coverpoint function with their respective port names. Then, for each coverpoint, I need to generate bins that cover all possible values. \n\nFor ACT, since it's a port, its maximum value is 2^port_width('ACT') - 1. So I'll use normal_bins with the range from 0 to that max value. Same for RST. \n\nOnce I have the bins for both signals, I can use the cross function to combine them. The cross function takes a list of lists of bins. So I'll create a list containing the ACT bins and another with the RST bins, then pass them to cross.\n\nWait, the cross function example in the API shows that you pass a list of lists. So the first argument is a list of bin groups. Each group is a list of bins. So for ACT and RST, each would be a separate group. So the cross would be cross([act_bins, rst_bins]).\n\nI need to make sure that the variables are stored properly. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Create coverpoint for ACT and RST.\n2.

The user wants to cross cover the value 1 of the ACT signal with all possible operations from the OP signal.\n\nFirst, I need to create coverpoints for both ACT and OP. For ACT, I need a normal bin that checks the value 1. Then, for OP, I should get all possible values. Since OP's maximum value depends on its port width, I'll use the port_width function to calculate it. Then, create normal bins for OP from 0 to that max value.\n\nWait, but the user said \"all possible operations represented by OP\". So maybe using normal_bins with the full range of OP. Then, create a cross between the ACT bin (value 1) and the OP bins. But the cross function takes lists of bins. So for ACT, it's a single bin, and for OP, the list of bins from normal_bins. Then, cross those two lists.\n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1. Create coverpoint for ACT and OP.\n2. For ACT, create a normal bin for value 1.\n3. For OP, get max value using port_width, then create normal_bins from 0 to max.\n4.

So when creating the cross, the first element is a list containing the ACT bin, and the second is the list of OP bins. Then, cross([act_bin_list], [op_bins_list])?\n\nWait, the example given by the user in the first example has op_bins as a list of bins (from normal_bins), and then cross([op_bins, [zero_bin]]). Wait, in the example, op_bins is a list, and the second element is a list containing zero_bin. So the cross function takes a list of lists of bins. So each element in the bin_groups list is a list of bins. So for the cross between ACT's 1 and OP's all values, the bin_groups would be [[act_bin], op_bins], which would create a cross of all combinations between the ACT bin (only 1) and each OP bin. That should cover the cross between ACT=1 and all OP values.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nact = coverpoint('ACT')\nact_bin = normal_bin(act, 1)\n\nop = coverpoint('OP')\nmax_op = 2 ** port_width('OP') -1\nop_bins = normal_bins(op, (0, max_op))\n\ncross_coverage = cross([ [act_bin], op_bins ])\n\nWait, but the cross function's first parameter is bin_groups, which is a list of lists of Bin. So each element in bin_groups is a list of bins. So in this case, the first group is [act_bin], and the second group is op_bins. So the cross would be between the ACT bin and all OP bins. That makes sense. So the code should be structured that way.\n\nI need to make sure that all variables are stored, as per the note. So the variables act, act_bin, op, op_bins, and cross_coverage are all defined. But the user's example didn't have variables for everything, but the note says to store all functional coverage objects in variables. So yes, all should be assigned to variables.\n\nSo the final code would be:\n\nfrom coverage import *\n\nact = coverpoint('ACT')\nact_bin = normal_bin(act, 1)\n\nop = coverpoint('OP')\nmax_op = 2 ** port_width('OP') - 1\nop_bins = normal_bins(op, (0, max_op))\n\ncross_coverage = cross([ [act_bin], op_bins ])\n\nBut wait, the cross function's example uses [op_bins, [zero_bin]], which is a list of two elements: the first is op_bins (a list of bins), and the second is a list containing zero_bin. So in the cross, the first group is op_bins, the second group is [zero_bin]. So for the current problem, the cross should be between [act_bin] and op_bins. So the bin_groups is [[act_bin], op_bins]. That would create a cross where each combination is act_bin (value 1) and each OP bin. That's correct.\n\nYes, that should do it.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom coverage import *\n\nact = coverpoint('ACT')\nact_bin = normal_bin(act, 1)\n\nop = coverpoint('OP')\nmax_op = 2 ** port_width('OP') - 1\nop_bins = normal_bins(op, (0, max_op))\n\ncross_coverage = cross([[act_bin], op_bins])\n```"}], "status": "ok"}, {"code": "from coverage import *\n\nop = coverpoint('OP')\nmax_op = 2 ** port_width('OP') - 1\nop_bins = normal_bins(op, (0, max_op))\n\nmovi = coverpoint('MOVI')\nmax_movi = 2 ** port_width('MOVI') - 1\nmovi_bins = normal_bins(movi, (0, max_movi))\n\nop_movi_cross = cross([op_bins, movi_bins])\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a verification engineer whose goal is to implement a functional coverage code snippet using the provided API in a Python based on the provided requirement.

The user wants to cover all possible combinations of signal OP with the values of signal MOVI. Hmm. So, first, I need to create coverpoints for both OP and MOVI. Then, I need to generate bins for each of them. Wait, but how?\n\nFor OP, since they want all possible combinations, maybe I should use normal_bins to cover all values of OP. Similarly for MOVI. But wait, the user says \"all possible combinations\", so that sounds like a cross coverage between OP and MOVI. Oh right, the cross function takes lists of bins and creates a cross coverage.\n\nSo first, create coverpoints for OP and MOVI. Then, get all the bins for each. Then, use cross with those bins. But how to get all the bins for each port? For OP, using normal_bins with the range from 0 to max_op. Same for MOVI with max_movi. Then, cross those two lists of bins. That should cover all combinations.\n\nWait, but the user didn't specify any ranges. So I need to calculate the max values using port_width. So for OP, max_op is 2^port_width('OP') -1. Same for MOVI. Then, create normal_bins for each port with their respective ranges. Then, cross the two lists. That should do it.\n\nLet me check the example from the user. In the first example, they used cross with op_bins (which were all values of OP) and a sel_bin. So here, the same approach: create normal_bins for both OP and MOVI, then cross them. So the code would be:\n\nop = coverpoint('OP')\nmax_op = 2 ** port_width('OP') -1\nop_bins = normal_bins(op, (0, max_op))\n\nmovi = coverpoint('MOVI')\nmax_movi = 2 ** port_width('MOVI') -1\nmovi_bins = normal_bins(movi, (0, max_movi))\n\ncross_coverage = cross([op_bins, movi_bins])\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the answer should include these steps. Make sure all variables are stored. The user didn't mention any specific ranges, so using the full range based on port width is correct. Also, the cross function is applied to the two lists of bins. That should cover all combinations.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom coverage import *\n\nop = coverpoint('OP')\nmax_op = 2 ** port_width('OP') - 1\nop_bins = normal_bins(op, (0, max_op))\n\nmovi = coverpoint('MOVI')\nmax_movi = 2 ** port_width('MOVI') - 1\nmovi_bins = normal_bins(movi, (0, max_movi))\n\nop_movi_cross = cross([op_bins, movi_bins])\n```"}], "status": "ok"}, {"code": "from coverage import *\n\nreg_a = coverpoint('REG_A')\nmax_reg_a = 2 ** port_width('REG_A') - 1\n\nbin_0 = normal_bin(reg_a, 0)\nbin_1_to_5 = normal_bin(reg_a, (1, 5))\nbin_max = normal_bin(reg_a, max_reg_a)\nbin_upper_range = normal_bin(reg_a, (max_reg_a - 5, max_reg_a))\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a verification engineer whose goal is to implement a functional coverage code snippet using the provided API in a Python based on the provided requirement.

The user wants to create different bins for the REG_A signal. The specific requirements are: a bin for value 0, a single value from [1:5], the MAX VALUE, and another single value from [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to get the MAX VALUE for REG_A. The port_width function can be used for that. So, max_reg_a = 2 ** port_width('REG_A') - 1.\n\nThen, create the coverpoint for REG_A. Next, each bin. For value 0, use normal_bin with 0. For the range [1:5], since it's a range, but the user says a single value from that range. Wait, the normal_bin can take a tuple for a range, but the user wants a single value. Wait, the first part says \"for single value from range [1:5]\". Hmm, maybe they want a bin that covers any value in that range? Or a single specific value? The wording is a bit unclear. But looking at the example given in the problem statement, when they said \"check that all values OP were checked against one from the first 3 values of SEL\", they used normal_bins for OP and normal_bin for SEL. So maybe in this case, the user wants a bin that covers any value in [1:5], but the wording says \"single value from range [1:5]\". Wait, maybe it's a typo and they mean a range. Alternatively, perhaps they want a single bin that covers the entire range [1,5], which would be done with normal_bins with (1,5). But the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\".\n\nWait, maybe \"single value from range\" is a mistake, and they mean a bin covering the entire range. Because if you have a single value, you'd use normal_bin with that value. But the user says \"for single value from range [1:5]\". Maybe they mean that they want a bin that covers any value in that range. So using normal_bins for [1:5], but the user says \"single value from range\", which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe they want to select one value from that range, but how? The API doesn't have a way to select a specific value from a range unless you specify it. So maybe the user intended to create a bin for the entire range [1-5], and another bin for a specific value in the upper range.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants a bin for value 1 (as a single value from the range 1-5), but that would be ambiguous. But the example given in the problem's first example uses normal_bins for a range and normal_bin for a single value. So perhaps in this case, the user wants:\n\n- value 0: normal_bin(reg_a, 0)\n- a single value from [1:5], which could be a bin covering the entire range, using normal_bins(reg_a, (1,5))\nWait, but the function normal_bins is for creating multiple bins for all values in a range. But the user says \"create a separate bins for: ... for single value from range [1:5]\". Wait, maybe they want a single bin that covers the entire range. But the normal_bins function would create multiple bins for each value in the range. However, the user might have intended to have a single bin that covers the entire range. But according to the API, the normal_bin function can take a tuple to represent a range. Wait, looking back at the API:\n\nThe normal_bin function can take a tuple (int, int) or an int. So, if you pass a tuple, it's for a range. So, for example, normal_bin(coverpoint, (1,5)) would create a bin that covers any value between 1 and 5. But the user says \"for single value from range [1:5]\". That's confusing. Maybe the user intended to have a single bin that covers the entire range. So in that case, using normal_bin with the tuple (1,5). But the function's description says that normal_bin checks that a single value or a value within a range is sampled. So, if you use a tuple, it's for a range. So that would be the correct approach.\n\nThen, for the MAX VALUE, which is the maximum value of the port, which is 2^port_width -1, so that's a single value. So normal_bin(reg_a, max_value).\n\nThen, for the last part, a single value from the range [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. Again, this is a range. So, the user might want a bin that covers any value in that range. But the wording says \"single value from range\", which is unclear. But following the same logic as before, using normal_bin with the tuple (max_value -5, max_value). However, the user says \"single value from range\", which might imply that they want a specific value in that range. But without knowing which specific value, perhaps the user intended to have a bin covering the entire range. So, using normal_bin with the tuple (max_value -5, max_value).\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nFirst, create the coverpoint for REG_A.\n\nThen, calculate max_reg_a = 2 ** port_width('REG_A') -1.\n\nThen, create the bins:\n\n- normal_bin for 0\n- normal_bin for the range (1,5)\n- normal_bin for max_reg_a\n- normal_bin for the range (max_reg_a -5, max_reg_a)\n\nWait, but the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\".\n\nSo \"single value from range [1:5]\" might be a mistake. Perhaps they meant a bin that covers the entire range [1:5], which would be done with normal_bins, but that function creates multiple bins. However, the normal_bin function with a tuple would create a single bin that covers the range. So, using normal_bin with (1,5) for the second bin, and normal_bin with (max_reg_a -5, max_reg_a) for the fourth bin.\n\nBut the user says \"single value from range [1:5]\" which might mean that they want a single value in that range, but not sure which one. Maybe they want to select one value, like 3, but the problem statement doesn't specify. So perhaps the user intended to use normal_bin with the range. So the code would be:\n\nreg_a = coverpoint('REG_A')\nmax_reg_a = 2 ** port_width('REG_A') -1\n\nbin0 = normal_bin(reg_a, 0)\nbin1 = normal_bin(reg_a, (1,5))\nbin_max = normal_bin(reg_a, max_reg_a)\nbin_upper = normal_bin(reg_a, (max_reg_a -5, max_reg_a))\n\nBut then, the user says \"create a separate bins for: ... for single value from range [1:5]\". Maybe \"single value\" here refers to a single bin that covers the range. So the code above is correct.\n\nBut the function normal_bin is for a single bin. So for the range [1:5], using normal_bin with the tuple would create a single bin that covers any value in that range. So that's correct.\n\nSo the answer would be:\n\nreg_a = coverpoint('REG_A')\nmax_reg_a = 2 ** port_width('REG_A') - 1\nbin_0 = normal_bin(reg_a, 0)\nbin_1_to_5 = normal_bin(reg_a, (1, 5))\nbin_max = normal_bin(reg_a, max_reg_a)\nbin_upper_range = normal_bin(reg_a, (max_reg_a - 5, max_reg_a))\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom coverage import *\n\nreg_a = coverpoint('REG_A')\nmax_reg_a = 2 ** port_width('REG_A') - 1\n\nbin_0 = normal_bin(reg_a, 0)\nbin_1_to_5 = normal_bin(reg_a, (1, 5))\nbin_max = normal_bin(reg_a, max_reg_a)\nbin_upper_range = normal_bin(reg_a, (max_reg_a - 5, max_reg_a))\n```"}], "status": "ok"}, {"code": "from coverage import *\n\nreg_b = coverpoint('REG_B')\nmax_reg_b = 2 ** port_width('REG_B') - 1\n\nbin_zero = normal_bin(reg_b, 0)\nbin_range1 = normal_bin(reg_b, (1, 5))\nbin_max = normal_bin(reg_b, max_reg_b)\nbin_range2 = normal_bin(reg_b, (max_reg_b - 5, max_reg_b))\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a verification engineer whose goal is to implement a functional coverage code snippet using the provided API in a Python based on the provided requirement.

Specificilly, create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE - 5:MAX_VALUE]."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to create different bins for the REG_B signal. The specific requirements are: a bin for value 0, a single value from [1:5], the MAX VALUE, and another single value from [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to get the MAX_VALUE for REG_B. The port_width function can give the bit size, so MAX_VALUE would be 2^port_width('REG_B') - 1. That makes sense.\n\nNext, creating the coverpoint for REG_B. Using coverpoint('REG_B') should do that. Then, for each bin:\n\n- Value 0: normal_bin with value 0.\n- Range [1:5]: since it's a range, but the user says \"single value from range\", maybe they want a bin that covers any value in that range? Wait, the normal_bin can take a tuple for a range. But the user says \"single value from range\", which is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe they mean that within that range, any single value is covered. But the normal_bin with the range (1,5) would cover all values in that range. But the user says \"a single value from range [1:5]\". Hmm, maybe they want a bin that matches any value in that range. So using normal_bin with the tuple (1,5). But the function normal_bin can take a tuple as a range. So that's okay.\n\nThen, MAX VALUE: that's the maximum value of REG_B, which is 2^port_width -1. So normal_bin with that value.\n\nThen, another single value from [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. Again, that's a range. So using normal_bin with that range. Wait, but the user says \"a single value from range\", which might mean that they want a bin that covers any value in that range. So again, normal_bin with the tuple (MAX_VALUE-5, MAX_VALUE).\n\nWait, but the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". So each of these is a separate bin. So for the first part, value 0 is one bin. Then, the range [1:5] is another bin (covering any value in that range). Then, MAX_VALUE is another bin. Then, the range [MAX-5 to MAX] is another bin. So four bins in total.\n\nSo, the code steps:\n\n1. Get MAX_VALUE for REG_B: max_reg_b = 2 ** port_width('REG_B') - 1.\n\n2. Create coverpoint for REG_B.\n\n3. Create bins:\n\n- bin_zero = normal_bin(reg_b, 0)\n- bin_range1 = normal_bin(reg_b, (1,5))\n- bin_max = normal_bin(reg_b, max_reg_b)\n- bin_range2 = normal_bin(reg_b, (max_reg_b -5, max_reg_b))\n\nBut wait, the user says \"a single value from range [1:5]\". Maybe they want a bin that matches exactly one value in that range, but that's not clear. However, based on the API, normal_bin can take a range (tuple) to cover all values in that range. So the code as above would create bins for each of those ranges. \n\nBut the user might have intended that for the [1:5] part, perhaps a single bin that covers any value in that range. So the code is correct as per the API functions. \n\nAlso, the user didn't mention anything about ignoring or illegal bins, so all are normal_bins. \n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nreg_b = coverpoint('REG_B')\nmax_reg_b = 2 ** port_width('REG_B') - 1\n\nbin_zero = normal_bin(reg_b, 0)\nbin_range1 = normal_bin(reg_b, (1,5))\nbin_max = normal_bin(reg_b, max_reg_b)\nbin_range2 = normal_bin(reg_b, (max_reg_b -5, max_reg_b))\n\nBut the user says \"create a separate bins for: ...\", so each of these should be stored in variables. The code should assign each bin to a variable. \n\nSo the final code would be as above. Need to make sure that all variables are stored. Also, the user didn't mention any cross coverage, so no need for that.

The port_width function can help here. So, max_mem would be 2^port_width('MEM') - 1.\n\nNext, creating the coverpoint for MEM. Using coverpoint('MEM') gives me the coverpoint object.\n\nFor the first bin, value 0. That's straightforward with normal_bin(mem, 0).\n\nThen, a single value from 1 to 5. Since the user says \"single value from range [1:5]\", maybe they want a bin that covers any value in that range. But the normal_bin can take a tuple for a range. Wait, the normal_bin's values parameter can be a tuple (start, end) or an int. So, using normal_bin for the range 1-5. But the user says \"single value from range\", which is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe they mean that within that range, any value is acceptable, but the bin is created for that range. So, normal_bin(mem, (1,5)) would cover all values between 1 and 5. But the problem says \"single value from range [1:5]\". Hmm, maybe the user wants a single bin that represents the entire range. But the API's normal_bin can take a range as a tuple, so that's acceptable.\n\nThen, the MAX VALUE. That's just normal_bin(mem, max_mem).\n\nNext, a single value from [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. So, the range here is from max_mem -5 to max_mem. So, using normal_bin again with that tuple.\n\nWait, but the user says \"a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". Does that mean they want a bin that covers any value in that range? Or a specific value? The wording is a bit ambiguous.

The user wants to create different bins for the IMM signal. First, I need to figure out how to handle each part of the requirement.\n\nThe first part is a bin for value 0. That's straightforward using normal_bin with the value 0.\n\nNext, they want a single value from the range [1:5]. Since it's a range, but they want a single value, maybe they mean any value in that range? But the normal_bin can take a range as a tuple. Wait, the normal_bin function's description says that if you pass a tuple, it checks for values within that range. But the user says \"single value from range [1:5]\". Hmm, maybe they want a bin that covers any value in that range. So using normal_bin with (1,5) would cover all values between 1 and 5, inclusive. But the user says \"single value from range\", which is a bit confusing. Wait, maybe they mean that they want a bin that matches any value in that range, so the bin is for the entire range. So normal_bin with values (1,5).\n\nThen, MAX VALUE. The max value of IMM can be calculated using port_width. So max_imm = 2 ** port_width('IMM') - 1. Then, create a normal_bin for that max value.\n\nNext, a single value from the range [MAX_VALUE -5 : MAX_VALUE]. Again, this is a range, but the user wants a single value from that range. Wait, but the wording is similar to the previous part. Maybe they want a bin that covers the entire range from MAX-5 to MAX. So using normal_bin with (max_imm -5, max_imm). But wait, the user says \"a single value from range\", which might be a mistake, but given the previous part, maybe they want the entire range. Alternatively, maybe they want a specific value within that range, but the instruction isn't clear. However, looking at the example provided earlier, when the user said \"check that all values OP were checked against one from the first 3 values of SEL\", the assistant used normal_bin with (0,2), which covers the range. So perhaps in this case, the user wants bins for the entire ranges. So for the [1:5] range, use normal_bin with (1,5), and for [MAX-5:MAX], use normal_bin with (max_imm -5, max_imm).\n\nBut the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". The wording is a bit confusing. Maybe \"single value from range\" is a typo and they meant \"all values in the range\". Otherwise, if they really want a single value within those ranges, but the problem is that the user hasn't specified which single value. So the most logical interpretation is that they want bins covering the entire ranges. Therefore, the code would be:\n\nFor value 0: normal_bin(im, 0)\nFor [1:5]: normal_bin(im, (1,5))\nFor MAX_VALUE: normal_bin(im, max_imm)\nFor [MAX-5:MAX]: normal_bin(im, (max_imm -5, max_imm))\n\nBut wait, the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\". The wording \"single value from range\" might be intended as a single bin that covers that range. So maybe the user wants four separate bins: 0, the range 1-5, the max value, and the range max-5 to max. So that's four bins. So the code would create four separate bins using normal_bin for each of these.\n\nSo, the steps are:\n\n1. Create coverpoint for IMM.\n2. Calculate max_imm using port_width.\n3. Create bins for each of the four cases.\n\nSo the code would look like:\n\nimm = coverpoint('IMM')\nmax_imm = 2 ** port_width('IMM') - 1\n\nbin_0 = normal_bin(imm, 0)\nbin_1_5 = normal_bin(imm, (1,5))\nbin_max = normal_bin(imm, max_imm)\nbin_max_minus5 = normal_bin(imm, (max_imm -5, max_imm))\n\nBut wait, the user says \"create a separate bins for: value 0, for single value from range [1:5], MAX VALUE, and a single value from range [MAX_VALUE -5:MAX_VALUE]\".

The user wants to check all values of the MOVI signal but also mark the value 3 as illegal. So first, I need to create a coverpoint for MOVI. Then, to cover all values, I should use normal_bins with the range from 0 to the maximum value of MOVI. The maximum can be calculated using port_width.\n\nWait, the port_width function returns the size in bits. So the max value would be 2^port_width('MOVI') - 1. That makes sense. So I'll compute that and use it in normal_bins.\n\nThen, for the illegal value 3, I need to create an illegal_bin on the same coverpoint. The illegal_bin will ensure that 3 is never sampled. So I call illegal_bin with values=3. \n\nWait, the parameters for illegal_bin are coverpoint, values, and at_least. The values can be an int or a tuple. Since 3 is a single value, I pass it as an int. \n\nSo putting it all together: create the coverpoint, get the max value, create normal_bins for all ranges, then add the illegal_bin for 3.

The \">\" might be a typo for \"\u2192\" (arrow), so it's likely another 1 -> 0 -> 0 -> 1. So three sequences in total. \n\nSo the code steps are:\n\n1. Import the necessary modules (though the example code starts with 'from coverage import *', but the user's previous example included that. However, the user's instruction says to provide just the required code, so maybe including the import is needed? But looking at the examples, the assistant included 'from coverage import *' in the code snippets. So I should include that.\n\nWait, looking at the examples, the first example starts with 'from coverage import *' and the second example also starts with that. So the user expects that line in the code. Therefore, the code should start with that import.\n\nSo the code would be:\n\nfrom coverage import *\n\nrdy = coverpoint('RDY')\n\nseq1 = sequence(rdy, [1, 0, 1])\nseq2 = sequence(rdy, [1, 0, 0, 0, 1])\nseq3 = sequence(rdy, [1, 0, 0, 1])\n\nThat's it. Each sequence is a separate variable. The user didn't mention any cross coverage or other bins, so just the three sequences. \n\nI need to make sure that the parameters are correctly passed. The sequence function takes the coverpoint, the sequence list, and at_least (default 1). Since the user didn't specify any 'at_least' parameter, the default is used. So no need to include that.\n\nYes, that should cover all the required transitions.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom coverage import *\n\nrdy = coverpoint('RDY')\nseq1 = sequence(rdy, [1, 0, 1])\nseq2 = sequence(rdy, [1, 0, 0, 0, 1])\nseq3 = sequence(rdy, [1, 0, 0, 1])\n```"}], "status": "ok"}, {"code": "from coverage import *\n\nreg_a = coverpoint('REG_A')\nreg_a_bins = normal_bins(reg_a, (0, 1000))\n\nreg_b = coverpoint('REG_B')\nreg_b_bins = normal_bins(reg_b, (0, 1000))\n\nreg_cross = cross([reg_a_bins, reg_b_bins])\n", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are a verification engineer whose goal is to implement a functional coverage code snippet using the provided API in a Python based on the provided requirement.

The user wants to create a cross coverage between REG_A and REG_B, focusing on small values in the range [0:1000]. \n\nFirst, I need to create coverpoints for both registers. Using the coverpoint function with their names.\n\nNext, for each register, I should define bins that cover the range from 0 to 1000. The normal_bins function can handle ranges. Wait, the parameters for normal_bins are the coverpoint, values_range as a tuple, and at_least. So for REG_A and REG_B, I'll use normal_bins with (0, 1000). But wait, the user said \"small value from range [0:1000]\". Maybe they just want that specific range, so the bins for each register should cover that range.\n\nThen, cross the bins of REG_A and REG_B. The cross function takes a list of lists of bins. So I need to collect the bins from each register and pass them as separate lists in the cross function.\n\nWait, the example in the API shows that cross takes a list of lists. For example, [op_bins, [zero_bin]]. So for two registers, I need to have two lists of bins. Each register's bins are in their own list. \n\nSo the steps are:\n\n1.

The user wants to check that the DATA register contains both the smallest and largest values. So first, I need to figure out how to get those values. The smallest value is 0, right? And the largest would be 2^port_width('DATA') - 1. \n\nWait, the API has a port_width function that returns the size in bits. So for DATA, I can calculate the max value using that. Then, I need to create two bins: one for the minimum (0) and one for the maximum (calculated value). \n\nBut how to ensure both are covered. The normal_bin function checks if a value is sampled. So I need to create two separate normal bins for 0 and the max value. Then, maybe use a cross to combine them? Wait, no, the cross is for combinations of bins from different coverpoints. Here, it's the same coverpoint, DATA. \n\nWait, the cross function takes lists of bins. If I have two bins from the same coverpoint, maybe putting them in the same list. But the cross would check all combinations. But in this case, the user wants both values to be covered. So maybe the cross isn't needed here. \n\nWait, no. The cross is for combinations between different coverpoints. If I have two bins in the same coverpoint, like two different values, then using cross would check that both are covered. Wait, no. Because cross is for combinations of bins from different groups. If I have two bins in the same coverpoint, maybe the cross isn't the right approach. \n\nWait, the user wants both the smallest and largest values to be covered. So perhaps two separate normal bins. But how to ensure that both are covered. Because each normal bin checks for their own value. So if I create two normal bins for 0 and max, then the coverage would track if each is hit. But the user wants both to be covered. \n\nBut the problem is that the coverage system would track each bin individually. So if I have two bins, one for 0 and one for max, then the coverage would require both to be hit. But how to enforce that. Maybe the cross isn't needed here. \n\nWait, the cross is for combinations. For example, if you have two coverpoints, and you want all combinations of their bins. But here, the same coverpoint's bins. So perhaps using cross isn't the right approach. \n\nWait, maybe the user wants both values to be covered. So the correct approach is to create two normal bins for 0 and the max value. Then, the coverage would check that each is hit. But the user wants to ensure that both are covered. However, the coverage system would track each bin's coverage separately. So if you have two bins, the coverage would be 100% when both are hit. \n\nBut the problem is that the user might have a scenario where only one of them is covered, and the other isn't. But the user wants to ensure that both are covered. However, the current API doesn't have a way to say \"this group of bins must all be covered\". So maybe the cross is not the solution here. \n\nWait, but the cross function's example shows that when you have a list of bins from a coverpoint, and another list, then cross checks all combinations. But in this case, if I have two bins from the same coverpoint, putting them in a list and using cross with another list? Not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user wants to use two normal bins for the min and max. Then, the coverage would track both. But the user's requirement is to check that both are covered. However, the coverage system would track each bin's coverage separately. So the user would need to check that both bins are covered. But the API doesn't have a way to enforce that. \n\nWait, but the user's requirement is to check that both the smallest and largest are covered. So the correct approach is to create two normal bins for 0 and the max value. Then, the coverage would track each of them. So the user would need to check that both bins are covered. \n\nBut the problem is that the user might not know how to do that. However, according to the API, the code should create the bins. So the answer would be to create two normal bins for 0 and max, and then perhaps use a cross? Wait, no. \n\nWait, the cross is for combinations between different coverpoints. So if the user wants both values in the same coverpoint to be covered, the cross is not needed. So the code would be:\n\ndata = coverpoint('DATA')\nmin_val = 0\nmax_val = 2 ** port_width('DATA') - 1\nmin_bin = normal_bin(data, min_val)\nmax_bin = normal_bin(data, max_val)\n\nBut then, how to ensure that both are covered. The coverage would track each bin's coverage. So the user would need to check that both bins are covered. But the API doesn't have a way to combine them. \n\nWait, but maybe the user's intention is to have a cross between the two bins. But since they are from the same coverpoint, that's not possible. So the answer is to create two normal bins for min and max, and that's it. The coverage will track each. \n\nSo the code would be:\n\ndata = coverpoint('DATA')\nmin_val = 0\nmax_val = 2 ** port_width('DATA') - 1\nmin_bin = normal_bin(data, min_val)\nmax_bin = normal_bin(data, max_val)\n\nBut the user might think that the cross is needed. However, according to the example in the API, cross is for different coverpoints. So in this case, the answer is to create two bins and not use cross. \n\nWait, but the user's requirement is to check that both are covered. So the code should ensure that both bins are covered. But the current API doesn't have a way to say that. So the user would need to check both bins. \n\nBut according to the problem statement, the assistant's job is to implement the code based on the requirement.

For DATA, I should use normal_bins to cover the range 0 to 1000. Then, for OP, since they mention the first four operations, I assume OP's values are 0 to 3. So I'll create a normal_bin for OP with values 0 to 3. Then, I need to cross these two sets of bins. Wait, but the cross function takes lists of bins. So for OP, maybe I need to create a normal_bin for each of the first four values? Or maybe a range from 0 to 3? But the user says \"first four operations\", which might correspond to OP values 0,1,2,3. So using a normal_bins for OP with (0,3) would cover all four values. Then, cross the DATA bins (0-1000) with the OP bins (0-3). But wait, the cross is between the DATA bins and the OP bins. So the cross would check all combinations of DATA values in [0-1000] with OP values in 0-3. That makes sense. Let me structure the code:\n\nCreate DATA coverpoint, get its bins for 0-1000.

So the cross is between the two lists. So the code should be correct. But the user says \"cross cover that register DATA contained value from range [0:1000] for first four operations from signal OP\". So the cross is between DATA's bins and OP's bins for 0-3. That should be the correct approach. So the code would be as above. Let me make sure I'm using the correct functions. Yes, normal_bins for both, then cross. So the final code should have variables for data, op, data_bins, op_bins, and the cross.\n</think>\n\n```python\nfrom coverage import *\n\ndata = coverpoint('DATA')\ndata_bins = normal_bins(data, (0, 1000))\n\nop = coverpoint('OP')\nop_bins = normal_bins(op, (0, 3))\n\ndata_op_cross = cross([data_bins, op_bins])\n```"}], "status": "ok"}]}]
