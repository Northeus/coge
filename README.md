# CoGe
Functional coverage generation using LLMs.

## Plan
 - Create neat interface with:
   * Constant, parametrized, and edge ($) ranges.
   * Multiple bins per coverage (with AND and OR aggregation).
   * Bin types: normal, ignore, illegal, default.
   * Cross coverage.
 - Add hooks to CoCoTB.
 - Create some simple examples.
 - Log statistics about coverage.
 - Create prompts for LLMs and have fun.
